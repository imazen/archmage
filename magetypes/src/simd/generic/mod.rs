//! Generic SIMD types parameterized by backend token.
//!
//! These types are the strategy-pattern wrappers: `f32x8<T>` where `T`
//! determines the platform implementation. Write one generic function,
//! get monomorphized per backend at dispatch time.
//!
//! All type definitions are auto-generated in the `generated/` subfolder
//! by `cargo xtask generate`. This file is handwritten and should not be
//! purged during regeneration.
